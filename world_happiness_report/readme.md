ðŸ“ŠData Overview

The World Happiness Report is a comprehensive global survey that evaluates the state of well-being across nations using data from the Gallup World Poll. The core metric is the Happiness Score, derived from respondents' self-reported life evaluations on the Cantril ladder, which ranges from 0 (worst possible life) to 10 (best possible life). The scores are based on nationally representative samples, weighted to reflect each country's population accurately.
The happiness score is explained through six key contributing factors:
GDP per capita, Social support (Family), Healthy life expectancy, Freedom to make life choices, Generosity, and Perceived absence of corruption. These dimensions are benchmarked against a hypothetical baseline country called Dystopia, which represents the lowest observed values globally in each category. The remaining, unexplained portion of a country's score is represented by the Dystopia Residual.
The data used in this report spans from 2015 to 2019 and is structured to allow both time-based trend analysis and country-level comparisons. Changes in ranking or score reflect shifts in well-being influenced by economic, social, and political conditions. This dataset enables users to explore not only where happiness is highest or lowest, but also whyâ€”based on measurable and comparable national attributes.
