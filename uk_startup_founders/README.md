# 🚀 UK Startup Founders – Power BI Report

This project analyzes startup founder data from the United Kingdom, with a focus on age, gender, location, and sector distribution.  
The objective was to investigate founder demographics and challenge common assumptions—particularly the so-called **“young founder myth.”**

The report covers the following:

- **Age Distribution:** Most startup founders are in their late 30s and early 40s, not their early 20s.
- **Regional Spread:** A significant share of startups is based outside London, including Manchester, Birmingham, and Leeds.
- **Gender Representation:** Women make up a small but growing segment of the founder population.
- **Sector Breakdown:** Technology, health, and finance are the most common industries among UK startups.
